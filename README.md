# Consonants-and-Vowels
Matlab consonant and vowel counter. Also includes a bonus lowercase string generator. 


This requires Matlab. If not Matlab, you can get it to work with a matlab runtime enviornment.

This was a test to see the speed difference between using for loops and using masks in Matlab. Masks are faster. 

The bonus string generator should not be used for strings greater than 1 billion-ish. 1 billion chars are 8 GB of ram. It makes lowercase random characters with no spaces.
